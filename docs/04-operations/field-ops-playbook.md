# Field Operations Playbook

This playbook outlines the procedures for Pure Street crews when using ESN in the field.

1. **Start of Shift:** Log in to the ESN mobile app and sync assignments.  Review the prioritized list of verified hazards.
2. **On Site:** Navigate to the hazard location using the app’s map.  Assess the situation and take any additional photos if necessary.
3. **Remediation:** Clean, remove, or otherwise remediate the hazard according to the hazard category and safety protocols.
4. **Update Status:** Mark the report as resolved in the app, adding notes or photos as evidence.  If the issue cannot be resolved, update the status accordingly (e.g. escalated to city department).
5. **End of Shift:** Sync completed work and debrief with operations manager if any anomalies or barriers were encountered.

Safety protocols and equipment checklists should be maintained separately and referenced during training.
