# Partner Onboarding

ESN collaborates with city agencies, BIDs, NGOs, and technology providers.  This document describes how new partners are onboarded.

## Steps

1. **Initial Consultation:** Meet with the prospective partner to understand their needs, data requirements, and desired outcomes.
2. **Scope Definition:** Define the scope of integration (data sharing, routing rules, access to dashboards) and sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) if needed.
3. **Technical Integration:** Provide API keys or credentials, set up webhooks or data pipelines, and test end‑to‑end connectivity.
4. **Training:** Conduct training sessions for partner staff on how to use the ESN dashboard, interpret metrics, and handle reports.
5. **Pilot Period:** Run a pilot to validate workflows and adjust configuration based on feedback.
6. **Full Deployment:** Expand to the agreed coverage area, monitor performance, and schedule regular check‑ins.

## Templates

Templates for MOUs, data sharing agreements, and bid proposals are stored in `docs/05-policy-and-procurement/`.
