# Problem Statement

Urban environmental degradation in cities like Oakland follows a recurring pattern: residents report hazards inconsistently, municipal systems log complaints but rarely produce structured analytics, data is fragmented across departments, and there is no verification layer or performance benchmarking for corridors.  Cleanup crews operate reactively rather than strategically, leaving environmental justice communities disproportionately affected.  ESN seeks to break this cycle by building a verification‑driven, closed‑loop platform.
