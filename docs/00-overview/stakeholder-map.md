# Stakeholder Map

ESN involves a diverse set of stakeholders, each with different roles and interests:

- **Residents:** Report hazards, use the mobile/web app, and provide feedback.
- **Field Crews:** Verify reports, remediate hazards, and update status via the dashboard.
- **City Agencies:** Integrate ESN data with 311, plan sanitation work, and access analytics.
- **Business Improvement Districts (BIDs):** Use corridor metrics for contract oversight and service prioritization.
- **Non‑Governmental Organizations (NGOs):** Advocate for environmental justice, analyze data, and collaborate on clean‑up campaigns.
- **Researchers:** Use open data and dashboards to study environmental trends and equity impacts.

Understanding these stakeholders informs our design decisions, user stories, and governance practices.
