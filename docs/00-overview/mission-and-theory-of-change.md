# Mission and Theory of Change

Pure Street’s mission with the Environmental Sentinel Network is to create an urban intelligence system that empowers residents, field crews, policy makers, and researchers to identify, verify, and remediate environmental hazards.  We believe that by transforming complaints into structured data—and closing the loop between reporting, verification, and action—we can drive meaningful improvements in public health, cleanliness, and environmental justice.
