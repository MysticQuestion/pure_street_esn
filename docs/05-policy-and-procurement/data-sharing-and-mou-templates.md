## Data Sharing and MOU Templates

This document provides guidance and sample language for establishing formal data‐sharing agreements between Pure Street, municipal partners, and community organizations.  A memorandum of understanding (MOU) defines the responsibilities, data access rights, and privacy obligations of each party.

### Purpose

To ensure that environmental data collected through ESN is used ethically and transparently, any partner accessing the system must agree to a standard set of terms.  These templates help you draft agreements that:

* Define the scope of shared data (e.g., hazard reports, corridor scores, anonymized sensor readings).
* Specify permitted uses (public health research, service delivery improvements) and prohibited uses (individual surveillance).
* Outline data retention and deletion policies, including how long partners may store ESN data.
* Detail responsibilities for protecting personally identifying information (PII) and for promptly reporting any data breaches.
* Describe the process for terminating access and returning or destroying shared data.

### Template Structure

1. **Introduction** – Parties to the agreement, purpose of data sharing.
2. **Definitions** – Key terms such as "hazard report", "corridor score", "anonymized data", and "PII".
3. **Scope of Data Sharing** – What data is shared, frequency, and format.
4. **Permitted Uses** – Allowed analyses, reporting, and public disclosure.
5. **Data Security and Privacy** – Encryption, access controls, and compliance with regulations (e.g., HIPAA when applicable).
6. **Retention and Destruction** – How long data may be stored and how it must be deleted at the end of the agreement.
7. **Liability and Indemnification** – Responsibilities in case of misuse or breach.
8. **Term and Termination** – Duration of the agreement and conditions for termination.
9. **Signatures** – Authorized representatives from each party.

### Usage Notes

These templates are starting points.  They should be reviewed by legal counsel familiar with local privacy laws and tailored to each partnership.  Keep versions of executed MOUs in the `integrations/` directory alongside any technical documentation for the integration.
