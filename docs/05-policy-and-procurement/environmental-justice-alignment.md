## Environmental Justice Alignment

Environmental justice (EJ) is a guiding principle for ESN.  Communities experiencing disproportionate environmental burdens—often low‐income or historically marginalized neighborhoods—must benefit equitably from the platform.  This document outlines how ESN aligns with EJ values and how partners can use ESN data to support equitable outcomes.

### Core Principles

* **Transparency** – Corridor health metrics, response times, and hazard densities are published publicly to shine a light on disparities and hold agencies accountable.
* **Community Participation** – Residents are co‑designers of reporting categories and verification workflows.  Field crews are recruited locally and receive EJ training.
* **Data Sovereignty** – Communities retain rights over how their data is used; nothing is sold or repurposed without their consent.
* **Equitable Resource Allocation** – Analytics highlight corridors where hazard density and delayed response times intersect with socioeconomic indicators.  This informs budget decisions for cleaning contracts and public works.

### Implementation Actions

1. **Identify EJ Zones** – Use census data and local planning documents to map neighborhoods with high pollution burden and low incomes.  Prioritize pilot deployments in these zones.
2. **Co‑develop Metrics** – Work with residents and advocacy groups to define what counts as a "successful" environmental intervention.  This might include improvements in hazard response times or visible corridor cleanliness.
3. **Report Inequities** – Produce regular EJ reports showing differences in service delivery across zip codes, race/ethnicity, and median income.  Make them accessible via the `docs/06-research-and-reporting` folder.
4. **Ensure Language Access** – Support multiple languages in the reporting UI and provide outreach materials in the predominant languages spoken in EJ communities.
5. **Feedback Loops** – Create channels for communities to challenge scores or submit additional context.  Use this feedback to refine algorithms and policies.

### Accountability

ESN’s governance structure (see `GOVERNANCE.md`) includes representation from EJ communities.  All partners must agree to the EJ principles and commit to public accountability.  Compliance is monitored via audits and periodic reviews.
