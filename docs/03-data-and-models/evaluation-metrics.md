# Evaluation Metrics

ESN’s success depends on its ability to improve environmental conditions and accountability.  We measure this through a combination of technical and social metrics.

## Technical Metrics

- **Precision / Recall of Duplicate Detection:** How accurately does the Verifier identify true duplicates versus distinct reports?
- **API Latency and Throughput:** Response times and capacity under load.
- **Data Quality:** Completeness of required fields (location, photo, category) and correctness of geospatial information.
- **Uptime:** Service availability for API, dashboard, and notifications.

## Impact Metrics

- **Hazard Resolution Rate:** Percentage of verified hazards that are resolved within their SLA.
- **Time to Verification:** Average time between report submission and verification.
- **Time to Resolution:** Average time between verification and hazard remediation.
- **Corridor Score Improvement:** Change in sanitation scores over time for targeted corridors.
- **Equity Index:** Difference in hazard density and response metrics between high‑income and low‑income neighborhoods.

These metrics will be tracked and published regularly to ensure transparency and to drive continuous improvement.
