## Citations and Sources Guide

The credibility of ESN research and reports depends on proper attribution of sources.  This guide outlines how to cite data and literature throughout the repository.

### Internal Citations

When referencing content within the ESN repository (e.g., schemas, taxonomy definitions, or other docs), link directly to the file using a relative path.  For example:

```
See the scoring specification in [docs/03-data-and-models/scoring-spec.md](../03-data-and-models/scoring-spec.md).
```

### External Citations

Use inline citations with tether IDs (e.g., `【1234567890†L10-L15】`) in narrative documents to refer to information from primary sources.  Tether IDs are generated by the research tool and ensure reproducibility.  Include the tether block at the end of the relevant sentence or paragraph.

Example:

> Cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine enable large‑scale geospatial analysis across thousands of machines, reducing analysis times from years to days【560882609875794†L24-L36】.

At the end of a document, provide a **Sources** section that lists all citations in order of appearance:

```
## Sources
1. Cloud platform case study【560882609875794†L24-L36】.
2. Google sustainability initiative【686557833543150†L48-L99】.
```

### Data Sources

If using external datasets (e.g., census data, air quality sensors), include a `data_sources.md` file in the relevant directory describing:

* Dataset name and description
* URL or access method
* License and terms of use
* Date accessed and version

### Citation Style

ESN uses a modified numeric citation style.  All external references are assigned a numbered citation, in the order they appear in the document.  This keeps the main text uncluttered and supports automated bibliography generation.  Avoid footnotes for core content to maximize readability.
