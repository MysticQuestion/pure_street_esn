## Monthly Corridor Report Template

**Purpose:** To provide stakeholders with a concise overview of corridor conditions over a given month, highlighting hazards addressed, response performance, and emerging trends.

### Template Outline

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Total number of verified reports received.
   - Average corridor score and change from previous month.
   - Key successes and challenges.
2. **Hazard Breakdown**
   - Table summarizing hazards by category (biohazard, dumping, hazardous material, infrastructure, blight) with counts and percentages.
   - Top ten individual locations by hazard count.
3. **Response Performance**
   - Average time to verification and resolution per category.
   - Percentage of reports resolved within SLA targets (see `docs/04-operations/sla-and-triage.md`).
4. **Corridor Scores**
   - Chart showing score distribution across all corridors (e.g., histogram or grade categories A/C/F).
   - List of the five highest‑performing corridors and five lowest‑performing corridors with context.
5. **Equity Analysis**
   - Compare hazard density and response latency across zip codes and demographic indicators.
   - Note any disparities and proposed corrective actions.
6. **Next Steps**
   - Planned interventions and cleaning schedules.
   - Upcoming community meetings or surveys.
7. **Appendices**
   - Methodology notes (data sources, scoring calculations).
   - Contact information for report authors.

Use this template as a starting point and customize sections to match the audience (city officials, BID board, or community group).  Attach raw data files (CSV) as separate exports when needed.
