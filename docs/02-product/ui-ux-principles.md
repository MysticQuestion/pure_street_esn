# UI/UX Principles

ESN’s user interfaces—mobile and dashboard—must be accessible, intuitive, and optimized for field conditions.

1. **Clarity:** Display only the essential information needed for the current task.  Use plain language and avoid technical jargon.
2. **Contrast:** Use high‑contrast colors and large touch targets to support visibility outdoors and on older devices.
3. **Speed:** Minimize loading times and support offline mode so that crews can report hazards even without reliable connectivity.
4. **Feedback:** Provide immediate visual and/or haptic feedback when actions are taken (e.g. report submitted, status updated).
5. **Consistency:** Use consistent icons, layouts, and interactions across platforms to reduce learning curves.
6. **Accessibility:** Comply with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast.
