# Accessibility

ESN is committed to making its interfaces usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.  Our accessibility guidelines include:

- **Color Contrast:** Ensure text and interface elements have sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be reachable and operable via keyboard.
- **Screen Readers:** Provide accessible labels, alt text for images, and ARIA attributes where necessary.
- **Language:** Support multiple languages and enable switching without losing context.
- **Input Flexibility:** Allow reporting via voice commands or simplified forms for users with limited motor control.

Accessibility should be considered at every design and development stage.  See [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) for detailed guidelines.
