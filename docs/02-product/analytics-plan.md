# Analytics Plan

Data collected by ESN must be transformed into actionable insights for stakeholders.  Our analytics plan includes:

1. **Operational Metrics** – Number of reports submitted, verification turnaround times, resolution times, and SLA adherence.
2. **Sanitation Scores** – Corridor‑level scores computed by the scoring service, with trends over time and comparisons across neighborhoods.
3. **Equity Indicators** – Correlate hazard density and response metrics with demographic and socioeconomic data to identify disparities.
4. **User Engagement** – Track adoption and engagement metrics (active users, report frequency) to measure program effectiveness.
5. **Performance Benchmarks** – Compare ESN outcomes with baseline 311 data to quantify improvements in efficiency and cleanliness.

Dashboards will expose these metrics to the appropriate audiences (public, internal, research) at different levels of granularity.
