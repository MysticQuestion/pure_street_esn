# User Stories

User stories help us understand the needs of different stakeholders.  Each story follows the format “As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].”  These stories inform our development priorities and acceptance criteria.

## Residents

- **As a resident, I want to quickly report a discarded mattress on my block** so that my street can be cleaned and remain livable.
- **As a resident, I want to receive updates on the status of my report** so that I know when the issue has been resolved.

## Field Crews

- **As a crew member, I want to see a prioritized list of verified hazards** so that I can plan my route efficiently and address critical issues first.
- **As a crew member, I want to update the status of a hazard after I’ve cleaned it** so that managers and residents see real‑time progress.

## City Officials

- **As a sanitation manager, I want corridor‐level sanitation scores** so that I can allocate resources based on data rather than complaints alone.
- **As a procurement officer, I want evidence of performance for contract bids** so that I can justify awarding work to qualified partners.

## Researchers

- **As a researcher, I want access to anonymized hazard data and metrics** so that I can study environmental justice and its correlation with socioeconomic indicators.

## Business Improvement Districts (BIDs)

- **As a BID manager, I want monthly reports on hazards and resolution times in my district** so that I can evaluate service providers and communicate with stakeholders.
