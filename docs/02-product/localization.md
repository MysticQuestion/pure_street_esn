# Localization

ESN aims to serve diverse communities across different languages.  To support localization:

1. **Message Catalogs:** All user‑facing strings should be externalized into translation files, using keys to reference messages in code.
2. **Date and Time Formats:** Display dates and times using the user’s locale and time zone (e.g. MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY).
3. **Directionality:** Accommodate right‑to‑left languages when necessary (e.g. Arabic).
4. **Number Formats:** Format numbers and currencies according to locale.
5. **Content Adaptation:** When translating, account for local cultural context and reading level.

The initial release will support English and Spanish.  Contributions for additional languages are welcome.
