# ESN Dashboard

This directory contains the operational dashboard for ESN.  The dashboard enables operations teams, city officials, and business improvement districts to monitor hazard reports, manage verification queues, view corridor scores, and generate exports.

## Structure

* `src/` – Next.js pages and reusable React components.
* `public/` – Static assets and configuration files.
* `tests/` – Unit and integration tests.
* `package.json` – NPM configuration and dependencies.

Refer to `docs/06-research-and-reporting/dashboard-spec.md` for detailed functional specifications and design considerations.
