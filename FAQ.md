# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the Environmental Sentinel Network?

ESN is an open‑source civic‑technology platform that transforms reports of urban environmental hazards—illegal dumping, biohazards, sidewalk waste, air‑quality spikes, infrastructure decay—into structured, geo‑verified data for action and analysis.  It is built by Pure Street to support environmental justice and sanitation in Oakland and beyond.

## What is ESN‑Lite?

ESN‑Lite is the pilot version of ESN.  It includes hazard reporting, basic verification, corridor scoring, a lightweight dashboard, and PDF/CSV exports.  ESN‑Lite is designed to prove the concept in a single corridor or city before scaling to the full ESN architecture.

## How do I deploy ESN locally?

Follow the instructions in the root `README.md` to clone the repository and start the local environment using Docker Compose.  You will need Python 3.11+ and Docker installed.  See `infra/docker/docker-compose.yml` for the services used (PostGIS, Redis, MinIO).

## Can I contribute even if I’m not a developer?

Absolutely!  We welcome contributions of documentation, user experience feedback, translations, policy and procurement expertise, and more.  Open an issue or discussion to get started.
