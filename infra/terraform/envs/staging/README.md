# Staging Environment

This folder defines Terraform configuration for the staging environment.
Staging environments mirror production infrastructure as closely as
possible, allowing you to validate changes before promoting to production.
Specify your resources (databases, message queues, compute instances,
networking) here. Use appropriate scaling and cost management settings.
