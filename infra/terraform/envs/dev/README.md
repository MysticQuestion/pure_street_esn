# Dev Environment

This folder is a placeholder for Terraform configuration specific to the
development environment. Use it to define resources that support local
development or low‑cost testing environments. Examples might include
development versions of databases, caches, file storage and compute
infrastructure.

Add your `main.tf`, `variables.tf` and other `.tf` files here. Do not
store sensitive values in plain text; instead reference variables or use
Terraform's secrets support.
