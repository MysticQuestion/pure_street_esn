# Mapbox Integration

This directory is a placeholder for integrating Mapbox services into ESN.
Mapbox provides map tiles, geocoding and other geospatial capabilities. A
future implementation should include:

* **Map Display** – Embedding Mapbox GL in the dashboard and mobile app
  for interactive maps and corridor heat maps.
* **Geocoding** – Translating addresses or place names into latitude and
  longitude coordinates for hazard reports and corridor definitions.
* **Static Maps** – Generating static map images for PDF reports and
  dashboards.

To use Mapbox, you will need an access token stored securely. Consult the
Mapbox documentation for details on rate limits and usage restrictions.
