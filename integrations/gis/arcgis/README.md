# ArcGIS Integration

This directory houses future integration code with Esri's ArcGIS platform.
ArcGIS can provide parcel boundaries, zoning layers and advanced spatial
analysis functions to support corridor risk modelling and environmental
justice research.

Potential features include:

* **Layer Import** – Import shapefiles, feature services and raster layers
  into ESN's analytics environment.
* **Spatial Queries** – Perform queries such as finding the nearest street
  segment or aggregating reports within certain administrative boundaries.
* **Visualisation** – Present corridor risk data on city GIS web maps.

Access to ArcGIS services may require API keys or OAuth tokens. Ensure
credentials are stored securely and refer to Esri licensing terms.
