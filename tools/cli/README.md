# esnctl Command Line Interface

`esnctl` is a lightweight command‑line utility for interacting with the ESN
services during development. It is intended to facilitate common tasks such
as running the API locally, seeding the database and inspecting status.

This tool is under development and currently provides basic scaffolding.
Future enhancements could include:

- Spawning containers via Docker Compose.
- Triggering database migrations.
- Sending test hazard reports via the API.
- Generating mock data for demos.
