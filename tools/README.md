# Developer Tools

This folder groups developer tooling used across the ESN project. These
utilities are optional but recommended to maintain code quality and
consistency.

## Contents

- **`lint/`** – Configuration and scripts for static analysis (Python via
  Ruff, TypeScript via ESLint) and style checks.
- **`formatting/`** – Code formatting tools and configuration (Black for
  Python, Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript).
- **`devcontainer/`** – Definitions for VS Code Dev Containers, enabling
  reproducible development environments.
- **`cli/`** – Command-line utilities for interacting with ESN services and
  data, including the `esnctl` script.
