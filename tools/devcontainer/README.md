# Dev Container

This folder contains configuration for a [Visual Studio Code
Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
Dev containers allow contributors to spin up a reproducible environment with
all dependencies preinstalled, including Python, Node, Postgres and
supporting tools.

Use the provided `devcontainer.json` and accompanying Dockerfile to
customise your environment. At present, these files are not included but
you can create them based on your project's needs. See the official
documentation for guidance.
